# VoiceLaTeX
A project to automatically turn voice into LaTeX.

The advantage of this over a mere voice-to-text translator is that this project allows for the configuration of which voice lines translate to what LaTeX formulas. In addition, voice-to-text to a scripting language is not greatly explored.
